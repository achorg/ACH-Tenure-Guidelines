	Clarified at hiring: outputs, terms of assessment
	Recognize that digital work is collaborative, process-oriented, labor intensive

Criteria:
	Describe methods, impacts, theoretical contributions 
	Describe process and labor
	Document review processes in funding agencies or other peer structures
	Describe roles in collaboration 

Assessment process:
	Native format
	Informed judgments by reviewers with expertise

Digitally specific:
	Peer review may occur before production in grant process

3) Modern Language Association, Committee on Information Technology

Expectations:
	At hiring, the expectations for productivity, responsibilities for departmental support
	
Candidate responsibilities

	Document grant successes, network building and the terms on which the digital humanities community ascribes merit or value
 
Assessment process:
	Written guidelines
	Engage qualified reviewers
	Respect medium specificity (native formats)
	Accessibility

4) AHA
Defining distinctions:
	Digitally published work in a peer reviewed journal is equivalent to print
	Digital work that uses “methodologies, argumentation, or archival practices that differ from print practices” need their own assessment
	Might include: blogs, digital storytelling, social media, or new digital platforms

Assessment criteria:
	Scholarly merit
	Native media

Candidate responsibility:
	Explanatory narratives

	Make the scholarly contribution clear
	Discuss documents with chairs and committees
	Bring colleagues into the work
	Seek support and guidance in preparing promotion materials
	Consider the impact of evaluation processes in advance
 
Departments’ responsibilities
	Become informed about developing contexts
	Before hiring: specify what counts as scholarly contributions
	Understand work that may be under constant evolution  / revision
	Understand how to assess tool and platform development
	Consider grant funding success as part of the assessment
	
Professional association responsibilities
	Create a working group for digital scholarship and assessment
	Foster conversations in the profession/discipline
	Sustain a curated gallery of digital scholarship with criteria
	Promote reviews of digital scholarship	


5) Laura Mandell, Texas A&M, Open Letter to Tenure and Promotion Committee

Assessment process
	Candidate responsibility: submit for peer review
		Scholarly Editions Committee, MLA 
		NINES, 18thConnect, MESA, REKn, ModNets
		Digital journals –same peer review process as print
		Prestige rankings: rejection statistics, contributors’ profiles, editorial 
boards, circulation
	Prizes
Technical reviews By peer-review journals

Criteria of Assessment:
Digitally specific: digital media are not “incidental but integral” 
Roles in collaboration need to be spelled out and made explicit
Technical criteria:
	Use of a coding standard (such as TEI)
	Database design
	Solid design principles in the user experience / interface
	Interoperability with other resources
	Does the digital archive/project fulfill its project goals
Assess digital archive production as an act of “curation” (filtering/selecting)
Assess tool and platform production to enable computational and/or digital work 
by others without technical support
Speaking engagements related to the project	

6) Professor Hacker (Adeline Koh guest post)
Candidate responsibility:
	Educate the audience/committees by defining peers and audiences
	Educate the reviewers about the nature of your project—what kind of project it is
	Document the roles in collaborations
	Explain changes in peer review—“post-publication” vs. “pre-publication”
	Address issues of gatekeeping and new media (blog posts, tweets)

7) University of Nebraska, Lincoln 
Digital specificity:
	Technical component lacking in traditional scholarship
Candidate responsibility:
	How does the digital format contribute to the uniqueness and originality of the scholarship

Assessment criteria:
	Peer review of sites or tools
	Collaborations with related projects at other institutions
	Links from other sites to the scholar’s research
	Use of standards (TEI, XML etc.)
	Technical innovation and sophistication
	Collaboration with experts in design and implementation documented
	Long term viability
	Compatibility of design, content, and medium
	Grant funding received (peer review process)
	Pedagogical application
	Conference presentations
	Print publications from the project
	
	
8) Nines Institute on Evaluating Digital Scholarship

Assessment:
	In the original medium and form/format in which scholarship was created
	Recognize the collaborative nature of digital projects
	Get each component of the projects reviewed by relevant experts
Considerations:
A. Organization of knowledge
	What community is concerned with this scholarship.
	What is the content – what decisions about inclusion/exclusion and how are these rhetorical choices?
	Have relevant standards for digitization been followed and documented?
	How do the elements/components interact (essays, commentaries etc.)
	Is the data structure solid
	Does the interface communicate effectively
B. Dissemination
	Is the project able to reach targeted audiences
Is the project linked to other projects
Where is the project hosted
C. Evaluation internal to the project
	Have user experiences been tested?
	Has the project been peer reviewed?
	Have papers been published on the project?
D. Sustainability
	Long term development plans?
	Potential for evolving or changing over time?
